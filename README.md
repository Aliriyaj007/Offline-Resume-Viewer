# 📄 Offline Resume Viewer

**A privacy-first, offline-capable resume readability tool that shows how your resume actually looks to a recruiter — instantly.**

> Paste your resume text. See it clearly. Fix weak language. Print with confidence.

## ✨ Why This Exists

Most resume tools today:

* Require uploads to third-party servers
* Lock features behind accounts or subscriptions
* Add unnecessary complexity

Recruiters, however, read resumes **fast**, **offline**, and **without mercy**.

**Offline Resume Viewer** exists to bridge this gap.
It is a calm, static, browser-native tool that lets you:

* View your resume the way a recruiter sees it
* Identify weak phrases instantly
* Make improvements without uploading your data anywhere

No backend. No tracking. No accounts. Just clarity.

## 🧠 How It Works (Simple Flow)

1. Paste your resume text (or import a `.txt` / `.md` file)
2. The app parses sections using lightweight heuristics
3. Resume is rendered into a clean, recruiter-style layout
4. Weak phrases are highlighted automatically
5. Toggle views, change theme, print, or export — all offline

---

## 🧩 Supported Resume Sections (Heuristic Detection)

* Summary / Profile
* Skills
* Experience
* Projects
* Education
* Certifications
* Achievements

> Detection is heuristic-based, not AI — predictable, fast, and stable.

## ⚠️ Weak Phrase Detection

The tool highlights **24 common resume weak phrases**, including:

* "Responsible for"
* "Worked on"
* "Helped with"
* "Familiar with"
* "Involved in"

Hovering over a highlighted phrase explains **why recruiters dislike it** and encourages stronger alternatives.
